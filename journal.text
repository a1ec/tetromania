Uninterrupted 9-4 PM, working mostly smoothly with pygame.
Started procedurally from tutorial at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF_crEtmpBo
https://github.com/educ8s/Python-Tetris-Game-Pygame/blob/main/game.py
Then gradual refactor into classes.

Session close with a prototype functionality: single block move around grid.
